## Project proposals:
[Google Doc initial report](
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zDExrRJAhWO2K9hIyktmuR7PUOF_EqtLiSvZsmc4im4/edit?usp=sharing)

## Requirement:
- [Online Education Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujaradha/online-education-system-review)

## Project Breakdown:
1) Data Exploration

Explore, find some insight. How the data distribute, what are the kind of attributes, what are the parameters, numerical or categorial attributes.

2) Praparing & Features Selection
    - Choose an attribute that will be available. Put the model into output a good model.
    Ex: Can be age, gender, class -> which one to choose
    - Convert string into numerical, or some other processing

3) Training

    - What is the model to use (Linear, Poly, Logistic, Neural, etc.)
    - What is the optimization technique to use (GDE)
4) Testing

How well is the model performing (MSE)

5) Post-Processing

    - **<u>Crucial Step</u>**
    - To convert data back into consumable format (plot, chart comparison)
